                    <br><br>Pros: 
                    <br>-Wanted by almost all parties.
                    <br>-Has by far the best party skills. (HS/Adv Bless etc)
                    <br>-Good survivability. (Thanks to magic guard, besides that they are not good at all.)
                    <br>-Huge amount of MP.

                    <br><br>Cons:
                    <br>-Only a few attacking skills (Big bang/Shining ray/Angel. ray)
                    <br>-Low DPS.

                      <br><br><h6>Arch Mage F/P</h6>
                    <br>Pros:
                    <br>-Utilizes a variety of skills in order to stack a multitude of DoT attacks.
                    <br>-The best DoT in the game by far.
                    <br>-Pro to ridiculously-funded players: DoT has no damage cap (or 2147xxxxxx may be the cap).
                    <br>-Mist Eruption does insanely high damage every ~12 seconds (with lag), even for low-funded players.
                    <br>-Great mobbers.
                    <br>-Decent bossers.
                    <br>-Decent survivability (Magic Guard Buff, HP/MP recover from Infinity, Elemental Resistance from Ifrit).
                    <br>-No Skill Book needed from Boss Zakum.
                    <br>-Elemental attributes and the ability to switch them off.
                    <br>-Summon Ifrit deals extra damage and support.
                    <br>-High MP to cast attacks.
                    <br>-Doesn't rely on weapon speed.
                    <br>-DoT ignores various monsters buffs.

                    <br><br>Cons:
                    <br>-Less popular than the rest of the mages.
                    <br>-Lack anything resembling a useful party skill (until Union when meditate gets 30 magic instead of 20 - but that's still sub-par).
                    <br>-When highly-funded, they are hindered by the damage cap comparing to other attacking mages that are also highly-funded.
                    <br>-Though they have great potential for bossing, post-Union they are severely overshadowed by Evans and ILs in that 
                    <br>regard at multi-part bosses.
                    <br>-Most skills look bad. (Depends on the persons oppinion.)
                    <br>-At popular bosses, they easily succumb to seduce+1/1 or Damage Reflect without the help of other classes. Thus it's 
                    quite hard, even for super-funded FPs, to solo/duo bosses like Pink Bean.
                    <br>-Summon might attacks enemies that one wishes to avoid.
                    <br>-No party skills. 
                    <br>-Relies on dispelable Magic Guard Buff against high damage dealing monsters/bosses.

                      <br><br><h6>Arch Mage I/M</h6>
                    <br>Pros: 
                    <br>-Proficient in harvesting Battle Points in PvP due to it's large arsenal of AoE attacks, status effects and ability to employ "hit and run" tactics effectively.
                    <br>-High maneuverability thanks to Teleport.
                    <br>-Chain Lightning has the largest potential directional range in the game for a staple attack thanks to its arcing 
                    between enemies, despite only hitting 5 at most.
                    <br>-A comparable attacker when compared to other adventurer attack classes in terms of %/s in PvE.

                    <br><br>Cons:
                    <br>-Glacial Chain's cooldown is not 5 seconds as advertised, but more like 8-10 seconds due to server latency.
                    <br>-Infinity has limited use at bosses that dispel frequently due to its 3 minute cooldown and 40 second (1 minute with 
                    Buff Mastery) duration.
                    <br>-Infinity's stance effect is 50% which in practice is not particularly functional, past this easily removed skill 
                    adventurer mages have no stance at all.
                    <br>-Very low HP, very reliant on dispellable Magic Guard for survival at end-game.
                    <br>-Seal does not work on bosses.
                    <br>-Vulnerable to 1/1 + seduce.

                  <p><p><h2>Description</h2><br />
                  Thieves are born sneaks. They're skilled at dodging attacks and are particularly fond of stealth, using their abilities to evade enemies or hide from them entirely. While out of sight, a Thief can slip past baddies unnoticed, or get into position for a sneak attack. Armed with daggers, claws and throwing stars, a Thief can unleash a lightning-fast flurry of blows that will take monsters by surprise. When Explorer-type Thieves reach a certain level, they can choose between two different specializations: Night Lord or Shadower.<br /><br />
                  
                  <p><h6>Bowmaster</h6>
                      <br><br>Pros:
                      <br>-One of the best 1 vs 1 attacking skills. (Hurricane)
                      <br>-Good third job mobbing skills (Especially usefully at jesters etc)
                      <br>-Good amount of speed, thus good mobility. Good mobility skills in general, since they have Double Jump and somewhat 
                      high avoidability by 4th job. They also have the highest speedcap at the moment and obtain the highest speed in 4th 
                      Job pre-Union patch.
                      <br>-No need for arrows due to soul arrow. (More space for potions/other use items). 
                      <br>-Good mobbing skills, starting from 2nd Job. Their second job mob skill (Arrow Bomb) curves and stuns, while the 
                      Crossbowman counterpart (Iron Arrow) does not.
                      <br>-Arrow Bomb in 2nd Job has the ability to stun.
                      <br>-They can use potions while attacking (Hurricane only).
                      <br>-Hurricane triggers Final Attack with every shot (obv at the % chance).
                      <br>-Hurricane is not affected by neither Booster nor Speed Infusion, meaning you do not have to waste money on Useful SI. 
                      <br>-Really good avoid/suvivability from illusion step in 4th job and good damage from afa and spirit link (which is also really good for hp). 
                      <br>-Elite puppet is very good for holding aggro away from you and for absorbing damage.


                      <br><br>Cons:
                      <br>- Low HP. Applies to all archers (someone correct me on this).
                      <br>- Must stand still in order to attack (Hurricane). Can not jumpshoot (technically they can but it's not an applied

                  <br><br><br><h6>Marksman</h6>
                      <br>Pros: 
                      <br>- Good amount of damage with pierce and snipe.
                      <br>- Mastery books are cheap.
                      <br>- Higher base damage due to needing less STR.
                      <br>- Good mobility skills for the same reason as Bowmasters.
                      <br>- No need for arrows due to soul arrow. (More space for potions/other use items) This applies to Bowmasters as well.
                      <br>- Rush skill (Dragon Breath)
                      <br>- They have the ability to freeze enemies in 3rd Job.
                      <br>- Good mobbing skills, starting from 2nd Job. Their second job mob skill does not curve and stun like Arrow Bomb for Hunters, however.
                      <br>- Going STRless is a lot easier to do compared to other classes due no STR requirement on armors.Applies to Bowmasters 
                      as well, should change this to "Going low-STR is easier compared to Bowmasters due to needing less STR to equip their weapons" as crossbows require 5 less STR than bows.
                      <br>-Both snipe and pierce are easily capped thus putting more funding into a mm only boosts strafe after a certain point

                      <br><br>Cons:
                      <br>-Pierce charges slowly and is not affected by Crossbow booster or Speed infusion.
                      <br>-Iron Arrow/Dragon Breath/Piercing Arrow have limited range compared to other skills. Elaborate?
                      <br>-Iron Arrow does not curve and stun.
                      <br>-Ultimate Strafe does not trigger Final Attack; Single Target DPS leaves much to be desired, especially compared to Bow masters. 
                      <br>-Female Marksmen can not obtain Decent Hyper Body.* Applies to Bowmasters as well.
                      <br>-Maxing Strafe if a pre-requisite for Ultimate Strafe, so they must sacrifice some points out of another skill to do 
                      so
                      <br>-Marksmen arrows are bulky and cannot be potentialed, when compared to the ones mercedes get.

                  Bowmen are nimble, long-range snipers. They have a variety of skills to help attack, evade danger, buff their damage, and launch arrows at groups of monsters. Bowmen can attack an enemy horde with arrow barrages, but are strongest attacking single targets from afar, as their long range is balanced by modest HP. Bowmen call the bustling town of Henesys, located in the southern part of Victoria Island, their home. When Explorer-type Bowmen reach a certain level, they can choose between two different specializations: Bowmaster or Marksman<br /><br />
