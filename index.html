                  The Warrior is a solid, well-rounded character perfect for players new to MapleStory. This character excels at defense, with large amounts of health and access to powerful suits of armor. These strengths help keep the Warrior protected when engaged in close-quarters combat against hordes of monsters. Warriors can wield the widest array of weapons in the game, including everything from swords and axes to spears and blunt weapons, as well as shields, and can specialize in their favorites as they level up. Warriors hail from the town of Perion, located in the northern highlands of Victoria Island. When Explorer-type Warriors reach a certain level, they can choose between three different specializations: Fighter, Page or Spearman. They can continue to level and grow, to ultimately become a Hero, Paladin or Dark Knight.<br /><br />

                  Thieves are born sneaks. They're skilled at dodging attacks and are particularly fond of stealth, using their abilities to evade enemies or hide from them entirely. While out of sight, a Thief can slip past baddies unnoticed, or get into position for a sneak attack. Armed with daggers, claws and throwing stars, a Thief can unleash a lightning-fast flurry of blows that will take monsters by surprise. When Explorer-type Thieves reach a certain level, they can choose between two different specializations: Night Lord or Shadower.<br /><br />

                  Bowmen are nimble, long-range snipers. They have a variety of skills to help attack, evade danger, buff their damage, and launch arrows at groups of monsters. Bowmen can attack an enemy horde with arrow barrages, but are strongest attacking single targets from afar, as their long range is balanced by modest HP. Bowmen call the bustling town of Henesys, located in the southern part of Victoria Island, their home. When Explorer-type Bowmen reach a certain level, they can choose between two different specializations: Bowmaster or Marksman<br /><br />
